A JSON/binary CRUD protocol for isomorphic Go applications. Limits its responsibility to handler registration and execution, delegating transport to separate packages.

## Features

- **Isomorphic:** Same handler code on frontend (WASM) and backend (Server).
- **Automatic Endpoints:** Generates HTTP routes (GET /users/{id}, POST /users) automatically.
- **Protocol Agnostic:** Decoupled from HTTP, SSE or any transport layer.
- **Batch Processing:** Logic to execute multiple operations from a single request.
- **TinyGo Compatible:** Optimized for small WASM binaries.
